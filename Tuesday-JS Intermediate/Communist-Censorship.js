// the task
//Given the array of strings X = ['Man', 'I','Love','The','Matrix','Program'],
//replace every letter of the word Program with *, so the output would be ['Man', 'I','Love','The','Matrix','*******'].
//Then make your algorithm work for any word of your choice

//Pseudocode
    //1- function taking two arguments arr and targetword
    //2-create new arr and new string, arr to hold the new arr and string to replace the target word into stars
    //3- loop through arr
    //4-if statement to check if the index of arr is the targetword
    //5-if it is the targetword, loop through its indexes and replace them with stars and push it to the new arr
    //6- if not just push the word in the new arr

//diagram

    //1- function will take two arguments on for the arr and the other for the targetword
    //2-loop through each word inside the arr
    //3-if statement will check if the word is the target word or not
    //4-loop through the target word's elements and replace them with stars and push in the new arr(result)
    //5-other words will be as well pushed into the new arr(result)
